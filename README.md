# DeveloperDayResources

Here you will find resources including code samples from the presentations for our Refinitiv EMEA Developer Day Series.

In order to run the Refinitiv Data Platform (RDP) Samples we demo'd - you will need:
1) access to the platform itself 
2) The Refinitiv Data Platform Libraries. These are expected to be in released in EAP in the next few weeks - 
so please wait for these to be made available. Once the Refinitiv Data Platform Libraries are stabilsed - we will put them into EAP and then upload the samples here (and on the Developer Portal). 

If you have not already requested access for these, please contact your Refinitiv Sales or Account Team and they can put you on the EAP list and you will be contacted shortly.

To run the Eikon Data API Samples - you will need access to the newest 1.1.x Eikon Python library. If you have not already requested access for these, please contact your Refinitiv Sales or Account Team to get access to this library as it is going into EAP very shortly.
